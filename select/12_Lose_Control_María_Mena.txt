Oh ohoh ohoh
Oh ohoh oh
Oh ohoh ohoh
Oh ohoh oh

Shame on you for making me wait
Time and time again you're too late
And I'm about to make a mistake
So please hurry babe
Oh just hurry

You might as well just take it from me
You said that I should take it from you
But I don't know if I agree
So please hurry babe
But don't you worry

'Cause I'm not convinced that I am worthy of your time
And I will do what it takes to make you mine
So sit back, relax, enjoy my show
This could be funny
Oh, I'm about to lose control oh ohoho ohoho

My back is aching, my feet are sore
But I'm still waiting, looking for more
I'm gonna stay here on the floor
But just you hurry babe
Oh just hurry

'Cause I'm not convinced that I am worthy of your time
And I will do what it takes to make you mine
So sit back, relax, enjoy my show
This could be funny
'Cause I'm about to lose control oh ohoho ohoho

'Cause I'm not convinced that I am worthy of your time
And I will do what it takes to make you mine
So sit back, relax, enjoy my show
This could be funny
